# Visual Studio Code
This is my custom build VSCode for personal use.

## Changes
- Change app icon for Windows, which is taken and edited from https://github.com/dhanishgajjar/vscode-icons
- Merge transparency pull request. (https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/52707)
- Change app name to Code for using same settings with official release.
- Add market info in product.json, you can browse marketplace in OSS now.
- Add [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) and [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), you can use them directly without install, just simply change your `editor.fontFamily` in settings.json.
